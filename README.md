YouTube Video Downloader (No Audio)

This Python script allows you to download videos from YouTube using the yt_dlp/pytube library. Currently, the downloaded videos are muted (no audio). This is likely because the script downloads only the video stream and not the audio stream. A future update may include merging both audio and video for a complete download.
